# Specification Quality Checklist: Patch Extraction and Normalization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-07-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Issue**: [GitHub #8](https://github.com/scottyUX/hecate/issues/8)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions are identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification

## Notes

- The S8-to-Stage-2 format decision is explicit in FR-012 and is elaborated by
  planning into a shared normative contract.
- Clarification scan found no remaining high-impact product ambiguity: candidate
  cardinality, wrapper handling, normalization, malformed storage, and scope
  boundaries are all explicit.
